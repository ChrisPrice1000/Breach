               Valued at $38 billion and boasting over 200 million monthly users, 
               Roblox is the world's most popular online gaming platform, 
               with a core demographic of children aged between 9 to 15.
            </p>
            <br>
            <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
            <p style="padding-top: 0px">
                Despite its commercial success and 17-year history of development,
                intruders were able to use an application programming interface (API) to obtain 
                millions of user records. This includes names, passwords, email addresses and
                other identifiable records.
            </p>
            <br>
            <!-- Paragraph 3-->
            <p style="padding-top: 10px">
                An API is a go-between for two different pieces of software.
                A popular example is weather APIs; most weather apps get condition information from an
                API belonging to an organisation like the Bureau of Meterology, which actually
                physically collects the data.

            <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
            <p style="padding-top: 0px">
                In this case, it's believed that the people behind this data breach, were able to access 
                roblox API that did not require authentication to access user information. The suspected
                API endpoint is now offline, meaning that no further information will be exposed.

                Roblox is still encouraging, it's users to be <b>"extra vigilant"</b>.
                <br><br>
                But what does Roblox means by this?
                <br><br>
                • Look out for any suspicious or unexpected activity
                across your online accounts.
                <br>
                • Look out for suspicious emails, texts, phone calls or messages
                on social media.
                <br>
                • Never click on any links that look suspicious or provide passwords,
                  personal or financial information.
                <br><br>
                Scamwatchs has advised roblox users to secure their personal information by 
                changing online account passwords and enabling multi-factor authentication on 
                their accounts.

                What we do know is that this was a <b>sophisticated attack</b>. The ip address kept moving
                and came out of various countries in europe. The FBI is working with roblox to obtain
                information and evidence needed to conduct the criminal investigation. Roblox saids it took action 
                to block the attack as soon as it learned of the brench and that "not everyone may be affected.
